# RayTracing
This is my implementation of ray tracing in a weekend using C++ understanding the inner workings of how a ray tracer works and practicing C++ on a more complex problem 

Most of the code in this repository is not of my own writing, and can be found on https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

all snippits of code are written by hand to enhance this learning exercise

this is purely a learning exercise repo

# RayTracing
This is my implementation of ray tracing in a weekend using C++ understanding the inner workings of how a ray tracer works and practicing C++ on a more complex problem 

The code in this repository is not of my own writing on the majority, and can be found on https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

all snippits of code are written by hand to enhance this learning exercise

this is purely a learning exercise repo

/start: 21/05/2023

lessons learnt
	- better understanding of the maths behind rendering/ray tracing (vector maths)
	- practice writing and understinding of C++ as a whole syntactically 
	- rendering materials and surface normals of objects
	- reflection and refraction of light on different materials
	- viewports, camera positioning and focal adjustments while rendering
